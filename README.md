# NanoReactor

Unofficial Implementation of the Nanoreactor

You should build TorchANI with `cuaev` for GPU-accelerated MD simulations.
Installation Documentation: [torchani/cuaev/README.md](https://github.com/cationic/torchani/tree/master/torchani/cuaev)

The official TorchANI repository does not include ANI-1xnr models.
Clone an [alternative repository](https://github.com/cationic/torchani) that contains the ANI-1xnr models.
